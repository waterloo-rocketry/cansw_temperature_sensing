# cansw_tempurature_sensing
Software which runs on the RocketCAN fill sensing board, and interfaces with the SPIdey sense temperature sensing boards to gather temperature data and send it over the CAN bus.

Known as "Does Whatever" since it integrates spidey sense with can. https://youtu.be/wl90tt4newk?t=11

The code was initially copied from https://github.com/waterloo-rocketry/cansw_fillsensing to make basic project and CAN setup easier, since this codebase also runs on the fill sensing V2 board.
